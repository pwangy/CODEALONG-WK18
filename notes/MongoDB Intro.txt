:: SQL: structured query language
  this is the language used for databases devs can use.
  more strict
  must define tables and relationships btn data.

:: no-SQL / SQL-free
  a less strict type of db would be called SQL-free

  this type can also be used to store relationship data - they store it differently than a relational db does.
