MongoDB Intro - Jennie, video

:: SQL: structured query language
  this is the language used for databases devs can use.
  more strict
  must define tables and relationships btn data.

:: no-SQL / SQL-free
  a less strict type of db would be called SQL-free
  by using this type, it can stay more like javascript within arrays and objects.

  this type can also be used to store relationship data - they store it differently than a relational db does.

  :: MongoDB on whiteboard
  
    This is a model. The name should begin with a capital letter and be camel-cased if more than one word.
      Inside the model is the object-property and it's property models. (name, age, isFurry). 
      The values are the type of values that are expected.
      This defines the structure of our data

  const Animal = mongoose.model("Animal", {
    name: String,
    age: Number,
    isFurry: Boolean
    })

      Now that our model is defined, we can begin to use the data.
    
  const doggo = new Animal({
    name: "Alfons",
    age: 2,
    isFurry: true
  })
  doggo.save()

    defining this new variable won't do anything. we must use 'doggo.save()' to save doggo to the db.
